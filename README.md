# phensim.R : an R package for PHENSIM tool

## Installation
Right now, the package can only be installed via source.
Download the tar.gz archive and use install.packages as below: 

```
install.packages(path, type= "source", verbose= FALSE, quiet= TRUE)
```
Since the package is basically an API interface, you need a valid API token (as requested during installation).
You can get a token via sign in on [PHENSIM website](https://phensim.tech/)
